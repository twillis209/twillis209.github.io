## TODOs from last meeting

1. Run Anna's method: 
  * use lupus and PID, 
  * How do the newly significant SNPs differ from those for cFDR? 
  * Construct Manhattan plots for SLE and PID overlap; are the novel SNPs near already-significant loci?
2. Writing: FDR, B&H, etc.
3. Completion of an `Rcpp` implementation of the `vl` function from the `cfdr` package
