## TODOs from last meeting

* Run Anna's method: 
  * use lupus and PID, 
  * How do the newly significant SNPs differ from those for cFDR? 
  * Construct Manhattan plots for SLE and PID overlap; are the novel SNPs near already-significant loci?
* Writing, perhaps PID given I read about it recently for my presentation
* Mimic Anna's R Markdown-generated GitHub diary
