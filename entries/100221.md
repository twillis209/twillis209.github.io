## TODOs from last meeting

1. Work up IgAD Bronson et al. data set
2. Run LDAK to select SNPs for Gaussian mixture fit
3. Write on PID
4. Fix icFDR script

## What I've done this week

### icFDR 

#### Differences in fitted mixture parameters are an artifact of my code

When writing the code to superimpose density estimates on the histograms we looked at last week, I thought to compare the estimates from `cfdr::fit.2g` and `cfdr::fit.2g.parallel`, my parallel implementation, as I have had trouble with the latter in my `icfdr` script. I have tested that the two implementations produce very similar estimates in the past and wrote unit tests to that end. 

The `cfdrQ` fits use the PID-asthma join asthma p-values and the `icfdrQ` use the PID-five IMD asthma p-values (a subset of the former), both thresholded to retain only those for which the corresponding PID p-value is greater than 0.5:

  cfdrQ_mixturePars
  [1] 0.9125358 1.5625140
  cfdrQ_mixturePars.parallel
  [1] 0.9125418 1.5625372
  icfdrQ_mixturePars
  [1] 0.9042702 1.5494240
  icfdrQ_mixturePars.parallel
  [1] 0.9974126 6.0104884
  
So the fits are similar for the `cfdrQ` data, but dissimilar for the `icfdrQ`. It seems the outrageous parameter estimates I saw for `icfdrQ` were due to my parallel implementation producing results divergent from those from James's serial implementation. The sole change made to James's `fit.2g` code was to replace the call to `optim` with `optimParallel::optimParallel`. Further, the `icfdrQ` data set was still large, 2,315,224 vs. 2,764,055 in the `cfdrQ` data set, so I do not think this is merely the result of a significantly smaller `icfdrQ` data set exaggerating the differences between the two implementations. 

Running LDAK was not a waste of time, though, as I now know how to do it if I use `fcfdr` in the future (probable) and if I need to generate a set of independent SNPs for another fitting purpose. 

### IgAD GWAS (Bronson et al. 2016)

TODO write about the fact that the top SNP falling outside of (but not far from) the MHC, rs116540075, is not mentioned in the paper; coordinates aren't given for the MHC but I suppose they just lumped it in with that.

dbSNP has nothing interesting on rs116540075 (besides the fact it exists).

I used the UCSC Genome Browser to look at the genome around the SNP, but there did not seem to be anything of interest around there.
