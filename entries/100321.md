# 10th March 2021

## TODOs from last meeting

1. Look into propensity matching and =MatchIt= as a means to match the MAF distribution in the independent SNPs to that in the whole set

## What I've done

The plot below summarises the situation with regard to the MAF distribution and LDAK-style independence.

No results to report from matching yet, still reading and experimenting with `MatchIt`. 

Naively, I have tried to match the MAF distribution of the independent SNPs against the dependent SNPs with the former being the 'treated' cases and the latter the controls using 1:1 nearest neighbour matching. It's possible to downsample the dependent SNPs in this fashion, but that's the opposite of what we want. I'm keen to make sure that we get the independent SNPs to match the MAF distribution of the whole set of SNPS, not just the dependent SNPs. 

There is still a lot for me to try, but I fear I will not be able to get around the need to downsample the independent SNPs in some fashion in order to remove the rarer SNPs and get a MAF distribution closer to that of the whole set. This would be a second round of filtering after first identifying the independent subset and prior to the `fcfdr` fit. 

I discussed the MAF issue with Anna on Monday and she suggested I look into `plink`'s pruning facility (I believe you too may have mentioned this). 

### Running `fcfdr` using z-scores

I presented results from PID conditioned on four IMDs last week (UC, CD, SLE, and T1D). I had mistakenly used auxiliary p-values, rather than z-scores. The results thus obtained were notable for the fact that we had no GWS hits from `fcfdr`. Bearing in mind we still have MAF as a confounder, I looked at the `fcfdr` results when using z-scores. I summarise the GWS hits below.

* UC: TNFRSF13B (`cfdr`) and PTPN2/LINC01882 (`cfdr`, `fcfdr` close to GWS)
* CD: TNFRSF13B (`cfdr`) and PTPN2/LINC01882 (`cfdr`)
* SLE: STAT4 (`cfdr`), CLEC16A (both) and IRF8 (`cfdr`, marginal)
* T1D: PTPN22 (both), CLEC16A (both), PTPN2/LINC01882 (both)

So not as gloomy a picture for `fcfdr` as it seemed earlier.
