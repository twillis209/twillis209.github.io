# 27th January 2021

## TODOs from last meeting 

    1. Hard deadline on writing for next Wednesday
    2. Run iterative cFDR as discussed today
    3. Start to prepare for the PID presentation
    4. Keep developing my version of the `cfdr` package

## What I've done this week

### cFDR results

*NB: I know these reports are meant to be a summary and a starting point for discussion in our meeting, but these results have such a strong bearing on our future work with iterative cFDR that I felt it best to write them up here in detail. It's not my intention to try to teach you to 'suck eggs' by including some of the cFDR theory (e.g. the mixture distribution estimation), but I thought it would save you the time taken to look things up.*

I mentioned `karyoploteR` last week as a solution to plotting more complex Manhattan plots. It took more time than I would have liked, but I got it working. Below are two plots which I wish I had had to hand last week. These are the result of conditioning PID on one IMD disease at a time.

### icFDR results

I decided to perform icFDR first on PID conditioned on the following set of IMDs
* asthma
* ulcerative colitis
* SLE
* T1D
* Crohn's

Taking the intersection of SNPs from six GWAS data sets means we consider a smaller set than when we take an intersection of only two data sets. How does this affect the results of a non-iterative cFDR analysis where we condition on only one auxiliary trait? 

I looked at PID conditioned on asthma where the SNPs comprised the intersection of PID and asthma only, and PID conditioned on asthma where the SNPs comprised the intersection of PID and all five of the IMDs mentioned above. 

#### How do cFDR and icFDR differ in procedural terms?

Joining PID with five IMDs yields 4,662,898 SNPs, whilst joining PID with asthma alone yields 5,565,565. With regard to p-values < 0.01, there are 52,300 in the PID-IMDs data set and 61,362 in the PID-asthma data set.
      
The cFDR procedure requires an estimate of the distribution of the auxiliary trait p-values (denoted 'Q') conditioned on H\_P = 0. A two-group mixture model is assumed: a mixture of N(0,1) and N(0,sigma^2) with weights pi and 1-pi. Thus we need to estimate pi and sigma from the auxiliary trait p-values. We use the function `cfdr::fit.2g` (or my parallel version `cfdr::fit.2g.parallel`), which produces MLEs of these parameters.

To fit the model, we use auxiliary p-values for which the corresponding principal p-values are greater than 0.5. This comprised 2,764,055 values in the cFDR set but 2,315,244 in the icFDR data set. How do the fitted parameters differ? 

	> cfdr_fit
	$pars
	[1] 0.9125418 1.5625372
	> icfdr_fit
	$pars
	[1] 0.9974126 6.0104884

I would say that's a pretty appreciable difference!

#### How do cFDR and icFDR differ in terms of their results?

52,300 p-values met the 0.01 threshold in the icFDR data, so we have 52,300 non-unity v-values in this data set. Comparing the v-values between the cFDR and icFDR data sets, none are precisely equal. The greatest absolute difference between v-values was 0.00917, which occurred for a SNP with:

* PID (i.e. principal) p-value of 0.007817 
* asthma p-value of 0.9979
* a cFDR v-value of 0.04164
* a icFDR v-value of 0.03248

(I'm not sure how much is to be taken from these data, but I thought you might ask about the particulars).

I created a histogram of the differences in v-values:

Manhattan plots for these data sets:

#### But where are the *actual* icFDR results?

I have not yet conditioned the PID results on more than one auxiliary trait at once as my script keeps running into errors on the cluster. I think these are down to my own programming, so they should be quick to fix.

### Reading and writing

There *will* be a draft of my writing on FDR by the time we meet tomorrow.
