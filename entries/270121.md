## TODOs from last meeting 

    1. Hard deadline on writing for next Wednesday
    2. Run iterative cFDR as discussed today
    3. Start to prepare for the PID presentation
    4. Keep developing my version of the `cfdr` package

## Agenda for today's meeting

## What I've done this week

### cFDR results

I mentioned `karyoploteR` last week as a solution to plotting more complex Manhattan plots. It took more time than I would have liked, but I got it working. Below are two plots which I wish I had had to hand last week.
