## TODOs from last meeting

(I don't list all of my weekly todos here, just the ones arising from our previous meeting)

- create plots of the `fcfdr` results we do have
- investigate distribution of SNPs by MAF in data sets; what does the distribution of rare SNPs look like?
- investigate relationship between MAF and p-values
- how does MAF affect likelihood of a SNP's being retained by LDAK?

## What I've done

### Comparative Manhattan plots 

TODO: ask about how to interpret:
- more tolerant of sparseness giving joins (two in the case of fcfdr)
- link to focused pictures on separate pages
- review reasoning re: MHC signal on chr6, =sle_pid=

For the four data sets on which I was able to run `fcfdr`, I created 'back-to-back' Manhattan plots comparing the results obtained with `fcfdr` and `cfdr`. In both cases, you are looking at the v-values produced by conditioning PID p-values on p-values from the named IMD.
