## TODOs from last meeting

(I don't list all of my weekly todos here, just the ones arising from our previous meeting)

- create plots of the `fcfdr` results we do have
- investigate distribution of SNPs by MAF in data sets; what does the distribution of rare SNPs look like?
- investigate relationship between MAF and p-values
- how does MAF affect likelihood of a SNP's being retained by LDAK?

## What I've done

### Comparative Manhattan plots 

TODO: ask about how to interpret:
- more tolerant of sparseness giving joins (two in the case of fcfdr)
- was PTPN2 GWS in Thaventhiran?
- which locus is close to SOCS1?
- write about fact that we didn't have frequencies in joined GWAS, had to go looking for them in 1000G

For the four data sets on which I was able to run `fcfdr`, I created 'back-to-back' Manhattan plots comparing the results obtained with `fcfdr` and `cfdr`. In both cases, you are looking at the v-values produced by conditioning PID p-values on p-values from the named IMD. For reference, here's the PID Manhattan:

Thaventhiran et al. did GWAS of antibody-deficient PID and 'all PID', and meta-analysed their results with those from Li et al. (a 2015 CVID GWAS). I believe the p-values I am using are those from the 'marginal' antibody-deficient PID GWAS, but I'm not 100% sure.

(I don't expect you to look at all of these, it was just easy for me to look at them by putting them on the web)

[PID conditioned on CD](/entries/030321/cd_pid.html)

[PID conditioned on T1D](/entries/030321/t1d_pid.html)

Two things to consider:
* `cfdr` and `fcfdr` vs. the original GWAS
* `cfdr` vs. `fcfdr` 

### MAF and p-values

I had thought I had MAF information to hand, but it turns out to be missing from most of the IMD data sets we are using. Guille has shown me a script to calculate MAF using the 1000G data and a designated population, but I have some reservations about the accuracy of such estimated MAF after comparing the numbers to those on dbSNP, and about the choice of the population. On the latter point, so far I have gone with the Utah central European cohort ('CEU') on Guille's recommendation. 

The T1D GWAS data did contain MAF and a brief investigation has shown there is something going on. In particular, it seems you were right that rare SNPs are more likely to be independent. A lot more to come on this front.
