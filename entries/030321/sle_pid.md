# PID conditioned on SLE

There was an interesting peak on chromosome 6 in this data set in the plot we looked at last week, but this was probably because I accidentally left the MHC in the `sle_pid` data set (the same code worked on three other data sets).

I identified peaks on:
* chromosome 2
* chromosome 6
* chromosome 16 (two distinct ones)
