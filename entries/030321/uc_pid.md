# PID conditioned on UC

I see peaks at chromosomes 17 and 18.

## Chromosome 17

SNP in TNFRSF13B was highly significant in original AD-PID GWAS (p = 1.37e-12). This locus has come up in past studies of CVID.

## Chromosome 18

It seems the signal is 'spread' over PTPN2 and LINC01882. This signal did not reach GWS in the AD-PID GWAS or the meta-analysis, but it does with the use of `cfdr`. PTPN2 was subject to detailed investigation in the Thaventhiran paper on the basis of its suggestive significance and COGS score.
