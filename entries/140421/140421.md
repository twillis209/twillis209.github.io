## TODOs 

1. Run fcFDR iteratively (with modified MHC, inclusion of SNPs for which we don't have weights)
2. Look at enrichment metric

## What I've done

### Offering comment on the fcFDR manuscript

As title, really. This turned out to be hard work!

### ifcFDR results

TMI (I imagine) but pairwise plots charting the progress of v-values through the iterations:

[Pairwise Manhattans](/entries/140421/pairwise_manhattans.html)

What if we permute the order of the auxiliary traits?

Comparing the final v-values from each iterative procedure, original and permuted:

On the normal scale, these v-values have a Pearson's correlation of 0.56 and a Spearman's rank correlation of 0.55. On the -log10 scale, the Pearson's correlation is 0.84. 

For v-values derived from principal p-values < 1e-5 (i.e. values which were at least 'suggestive' in the original GWAS), the -log10 Pearson's correlation of the final v-values goes to 0.99. For principal p-values < 1e-2, it is 0.94.

I'm not sure to what extent we expect this disagreement; are iterations meant to commute? 

### Enrichment metric

Recall your definition:

```
y_alpha = | { i : p_i <= p_alpha, q_i <= q_alpha } | / | { i : q_i <= q_alpha } |
```

If we multiply top and bottom by a factor of `1/n`, then the numerator looks like an estimate of `Pr(P <= p_alpha, Q <= q_alpha)` and the bottom an estimate of `Pr(Q <= q_alpha)`. Naively, I would say the underlying random quantity we are thus trying to estimate is `Y_alpha = Pr(P <= p_alpha | Q <= q_alpha`. Under the null that `P` and `Q` are independent, we have `Y_alpha = alpha`. 

To make possible comparison between different choices of quantile, we can look at `Y_alpha / alpha`. Then `y_alpha / alpha > 1` indicates positive enrichment and `y_alpha / alpha < 1` negative enrichment. Naturally, we can shift things to a log scale. 

How do things look if we test this on the data we have to hand?

I'm worried about the effect of small numbers on the metric and the need to select a good quantile a priori, but this looks encouraging.
