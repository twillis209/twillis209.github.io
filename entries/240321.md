## TODOs from last meeting

1. Implement sampling scheme in `fcfdr`
2. Run `fcfdr` on PID and the IMDs

## What I've done

### Implementing sampling scheme in `fcfdr`

This was straightforward. It's done. 

### Reading the `cfdr` and `fcfdr` papers

Nothing to show for this but I've had my head in these this week. 

### Running `fcfdr` on PID and the IMDs

I first confirmed I could run the updated `fcfdr::flexible_cfdr` function on simple random data sets and the package sample data (~110k row data set); these have since become unit tests for the package. I then moved on to the IMD data. Unfortunately I have encountered the following error:

```
Error in value[[3L]](cond) : 
  inapplicable choice of bandwidth (eps=NULL) in midpoint rule:
Error in owin(poly = list(x = c(1, 0, 0, 1), y = c(lims[4], lims[4], lims[3], : could
 not find function "owin"
Calls: <Anonymous> ... tryCatch -> tryCatchList -> tryCatchOne -> <Anonymous>
Execution halted
```

I'm far from exhausting all avenues on this.

### Can we use one set of LDAK weights for all data sets?

I previously computed LDAK weights for all data sets. Anna suggested I might just reuse the weights from one data set for all others, in the same way as I intend to reuse the T1D MAF values. How would I fare with this approach? What should we tell users?

I joined the weights computed for all data sets with those for T1D. For our purposes the correlation of the weight values between the data sets are not so important, although I have included those values below to illustrate that the SNPs included in the input set do matter as far as LDAK is concerned. When running `fcfdr`, we care if the weights are zero or non-zero, i.e. whether they indicate dependence or independence.

The last column in particular makes me wonder how this impacts results. Once I get `fcfdr` working again, I will compare results obtained with and without a GWAS-specific set of LDAK weights.
