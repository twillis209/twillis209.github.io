## TODOs from last meeting

1. Run FDR regression as a comparison
2. Zoom in on iterative results
3. Spend more time (but not all of it) on the first-year report

## What I've done

Last week was APTS and I also spent time on the fcFDR manuscript and writing a vignette on use of LDAK with `fcfdr` for the package website.

I did no substantive work on PID. I reran the pairwise and iterative analyses (including a permuted form of the latter) after identifying some issues with my previous workflow when writing the LDAK vignette. 

I returned to writing the first-year report last week and found some problems with my coverage of PID. In particular, I found my discussion of CVID as a polygenic disease unconvincing and in some places, I had misunderstood the papers cited. I have since been rereading CVID GWAS and WGS papers.
