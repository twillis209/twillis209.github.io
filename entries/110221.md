# Update on Gaussian mixture fits (11th February 2021)

Reminder: the `cfdr.q.mixture` fit uses the PID-asthma join asthma p-values and the `icfdr.q.mixture` fit uses the PID-five IMD asthma p-values (a subset of PID-asthma join values), and both sets of data are thresholded to retain only those asthma p-values for which the corresponding PID p-value is greater than 0.5:

    > cfdr.q.mixture$pars
    [1] 0.9125358 1.5625140
    > icfdr.q.mixture$pars
    [1] 0.9042702 1.5494240

The first parameter is pi, the mixing weight, and the second is sigma, the standard deviation of the non-standard normal component of the mixture. 

I originally thought to look at these values a few weeks ago when performing the first step of an iterative cFDR analysis. At the time I was using my own parallel implementation of `fit.2g` which produced a far larger estimate of sigma, >6, for the `icfdr.q` data set. This caused me to look at the fit in more detail. I've since discarded the parallel fits and what you see above are the fits obtained with James's original (serial) implementation.

How do the fits compare to the empirical distribution of the data visually? We could look at these data on a p-value or z-score scale. Here I've done the former, but I didn't think about the fact that I made that choice until after I produced the plots below. I don't think it should make too much of a difference to our interpretation.

For the fit to each data set, I sampled from the fitted mixture distribution and plotted this sample alongside the original data:

Looking at the data on the -log10 scale makes things clearer for smaller values:

The fit seems good in both cases for data in the interval (0,10]. For (10,24] it's not. These values make up a very small proportion of the data, though:

| Data set | No. of values used for fit | (0,4]              | (4,10]       | (10, 24]       |
|----------|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------|----------------|
| cFDR     | 2,764,055                  | 2,760,644 (99.9%)  | 3058 (0.11%) | 231 (0.00836%) |
| icFDR    | 2,315,224                  | 2,312,316  (99.9%) | 2578 (0.11%) | 220 (0.0095%)  |

What influence does this small number of very small p-values have upon the fit? What happens to the estimated parameters if we omit them?
