# 17th February 2021

## TODOs from last meeting

1. Use LDAK weights in Gaussian mixture fit
2. Write on PID
3. Fix icFDR script

## `cfdr` vs. `fcfdr`

Now that I have a way to generate LDAK weights, I can run `fcfdr`. It was easy in the past to simply opt for `cfdr` whilst I didn't have a means of running `fcfdr`, but now that I can run both, which should I prefer?

I bring this up as a talking point as the methodological developments we hope to make in the future will be built on top of one of the two of these; is `fcfdr` likely to be a better foundation? 

## What I've done this week

### Gaussian mixture fits with LDAK

#### Summary of February 11th update

I posted an update on February 11th. Summarising that:

1. the PID-asthma and PID-5 IMDs data sets produced similar fits:

    > cfdr.q.mixture$pars
    [1] 0.9125358 1.5625140
    > icfdr.q.mixture$pars
    [1] 0.9042702 1.5494240

2. as judged by histograms of samples drawn from the fitted mixtures (see February 11th page), the fit was good but for the -log10(p) values in the interval (10, 24], which were <0.01% of values in both data sets
3. this small set of values still has some influence on the fit as demonstrated by the fits when they are omitted (indicated by `.sub`):

    > cfdr.q.mixture$pars
    [1] 0.9125358 1.5625140
    > cfdr.q.mixture.sub$pars
    [1] 0.8858314 1.4585830
    > icfdr.q.mixture$pars
    [1] 0.9042702 1.5494240
    > icfdr.q.mixture.sub$pars
    [1] 0.8732942 1.4411168
    
#### Use of LDAK weights

What happens when we use the LDAK weights in these fits? 

Recall that the original issue here was that the PID-5 IMDs data set (to be used in icFDR) used a subset of the SNPs from the PID-asthma data set. Unfortunately, the 1000G data used to generate LDAK weights does not contain a superset of the SNPs considered in either the PID-asthma or the PID-5 IMDs data set, so using weights means that we necessarily downsample the SNPs used in the fit before we even consider the weights themselves (some of which will be 0). 

First the fits to the PID-asthma data set. I use `.sub` to denote the subset of SNPs from the data set which were present in the 1000G data and for which we have LDAK weights (whether or not they are 0). The three fits are thus:

- `unweighted.cfdr.fit`: the PID-asthma data set
- `unweighted.cfdr.fit.sub`: the intersection of the PID-asthma SNPs with the 1000G SNPs, without the use of LDAK weights
- `weighted.cfdr.fit.sub`: the intersection of the PID-asthma SNPs with the 1000G SNPs, with the use of LDAK weights

    > unweighted.cfdr.fit$pars
    [1] 0.9125358 1.5625140
    > unweighted.cfdr.fit.sub$pars
    [1] 0.9359017 1.4347647
    > weighted.cfdr.fit.sub$pars
    [1] 0.9297812 1.3321573
    
and the fits to the PID-5 IMDs data set 
    
    > unweighted.icfdr.fit$pars
    [1] 0.9042702 1.5494240
    > unweighted.icfdr.fit.sub$pars
    [1] 0.9316821 1.4512394
    > weighted.icfdr.fit.sub$pars
    [1]  0.9999664 10.4109346
    
What do the fits look like in terms of histograms of the original data and samples drawn from the fitted weighted mixture?

### PID reading and writing

I will have a full draft of my section on PID ready for tomorrow.

### icFDR script 

As noted some time ago, I ran into an unknown problem when running cFDR iteratively. I've since narrowed this issue down to `cfdr::il` returning a `NaN` value after several iterations. Not much more to say on this for now, I continue to troubleshoot it.
