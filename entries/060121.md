# 6th January 2020

## TODOs from last meeting (actually from the meeting before that)

1. Run Anna's method: 
  * use lupus and PID, 
  * How do the newly significant SNPs differ from those for cFDR? 
  * Construct Manhattan plots for SLE and PID overlap; are the novel SNPs near already-significant loci?
2. Writing (maybe this should always be here)

## What I did over the break

We last met on December 16th amidst the APTS week. I spent the last week of term on APTS, then took two weeks of annual leave. 

### `fcfdr`

To summarise what I reported on the 16th, it was necessary to download a fresh copy of the 1000 Genomes data. I need to subset these for the relevant SNPs before I pass them to LDAK to generate the weights needed as an input to `fcfdr`.

### `cfdr`

I would like to make a complete effort at an `Rcpp` implementation of the `vl` function and I am about halfway through this.

## Agenda for today's meeting

Nothing to discuss.
