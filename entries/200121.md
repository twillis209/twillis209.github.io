## Agenda for today's meeting

## TODOs from last meeting 

1. Integrating my `Rcpp` implementation of `vl` into the `cfdr` package
2. Writing on FDR, BH, etc.
3. Interrogating the cFDR results after removing the MHC
4. Run Anna's method: 
  * use lupus and PID, 
  * How do the newly significant SNPs differ from those for cFDR? 
  * Construct Manhattan plots for SLE and PID overlap; are the novel SNPs near already-significant loci?

## What I've done this week

### `fcfdr` 

I keep pushing my use of `fcfdr` to the back of the queue and nothing ever gets done. I'm not close to producing results from it so I think it is best to drop it from my agenda for now as I would rather press ahead with the 'inflexible' cFDR analysis. 

### `cfdr`

I had been using my `Rcpp` code in a rather ad hoc way, invoking `sourceCpp` in my cFDR script to compile at runtime the code in a `cpp` file in the script's working directory.

I did some reading on the topic of R packages and `Rcpp` integration, and my `vl` implementation is now integrated into the `cfdr` package along with its tests and documentation. I was able to install the package from my local git repo with `devtools::install` and make use of it in scripts through `library(cfdr)` in the usual way. 

I wrote three `Rcpp` functions: `vl_mode2`, `ecdf_cpp`, and `approx_cpp`. The last two functions are `Rcpp` implementations of the `stats` functions `ecdf` and `approx` and are used in `vl_mode2`. At the moment, I am not exporting any of these functions and instead just using them behind the scenes. `vl` is invoked in the same way as before, but if the `fold` and `indices` arguments are supplied, and we have `mode=2`, then `vl` calls `vl_mode2` (that is, the R function invokves the `Rcpp` function). I have verified that this works with my cFDR script, such that the use of `Rcpp` is now completely transparent to the user besides the running time.

Before submitting a pull request, I would like to chase down all of the warnings given by `devtools::build`. I'm also not sure if my handling of imports is considered good practice. The package could do with unit tests, too: at present there are none besides those I wrote for my own `Rcpp` functions. Writing these would help me get up to speed on testing in R and with how the package works. Delaying the pull request is not a hindrance to my current work as my local install incorporates the changes I have made.

Also, I think James might be a bit too busy to consider the pull request: he has not responded to the pull request I submitted on November 20th to fix some bugs in the vignette. Do we know if anyone uses `cfdr` besides ourselves?

### Reading and writing

My thoughts have turned to those steps which lie downstream of GWAS as this no longer seems so far away. The talk from Kaur Alasoo last Tuesday prompted me to attempt to read the paper on the eQTL Catalogue on which he worked, but I realised I knew next to nothing about eQTLs, so read up on that topic in general.   

I still do not have enough writing to submit for review. I do spend a lot of time, as I read and write, thinking about what makes it so hard for me to put words on the page of the first-year report. I take copious notes on the papers I read but have a hard time translating this into copy for the report.

### cFDR results

From our Slack communications last week:

>My other question is, you are identifying a lot of new hits - what are they?  What does the before/after manhattan plot look like?
