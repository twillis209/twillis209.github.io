## TODOs 

1. Writing on PID
2. fcFDR applied to IMDs


## What I've done

### Writing on PID

I had a bit of a rough week personally (sleep, lockdown) and I didn't get my writing done as a result.

### fcFDR applied to PID and the IMDs

#### Bug from last week

A bug held me up last week but I talked with Anna and we've since resolved this. It turned out that `spatstat` had since been split up into several packages and we needed to import the relevant function (`owin`) from `spatstat.geom` instead.

#### Comparing fcFDR with and without matching

In short, there appears to be no easily discernible differences between the results produced with and without matching, although I still think matching is the judicious thing to do. In addition, downsampling the independent SNPs cuts down on the running time, although `fcFDR` is very quick in comparison to `cFDR`, anyway.

Manhattans in case you would like to look, but I can't see the difference. Note that I carried over the T1D minor allele frequencies here.

Running times:

|----------|---------------------|-------------------|

#### Comparing fcFDR with cFDR on IMDs

The fcFDR results were worrying for want of genome-wide significant SNPs: of seven IMDs, only one (asthma/allergy/eczema) yielded a borderline significant SNP on chromosome 4.

Why is this?

The PID data set consists of GWAS summary statistics of antibody-deficient PID of SNPs of intermediate and common frequency MAF, > 0.005 (I think, anyway, it's not made entirely clear in the EBI GWAS Catalog nor the paper itself which data set was uploaded). There was only one genome-wide significant tower outside of the MHC, at chromosome 17, so it was not the most signal-rich data set. But then again, there were a plethora of borderline/suggesitve signals and are we not using cFDR methods to 'promote' such signals to significance in the first place?

The stratified Q-Q plots we've looked at it in the past provide encouraging signs of enrichment among the IMD data sets. However, I generated correlation plots using Anna's code from the `fcfdr` package and these seem to show no sign of enrichment. Nonetheless, `cfdr` is clearly picking up something in the same data sets. 

I've often returned to the issue of how performing inner joins on data sets leads to our losing some SNPs, whether we are joining two sets of summary statistics, summary statistics and MAF values (from T1D), or summary statistics and LDAK weights (in practice this amounts to joining summary statistic SNPs and those in the 1000G data). In the case of the `fcfdr`, we've performed all three such joins, whereas the `cfdr` data sets have been through only the first of these joins. It shows: the `cfdr` data sets may have one million more SNPs than the `fcfdr` data sets (in the case of the `aster` data). How do the Manhattan plots differ when we downsample the `cfdr` results to have the same SNPs as in the `fcfdr` results? It's not a fair comparison, as the `cfdr` procedure still gets the benefit of those SNPs in the actual procedure.

So we are missing some SNPs in the `fcfdr` data sets. Are they the important ones? I looked at the top 20 SNPs per chromosome in the PID GWAS and whether they were retained in the `fcfdr` data sets. 

TODO fix these data

| Data set | No. of missing SNPs from top 20 across all chromosomes |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| aster    |                                                    364 |
| asthma   |                                                    428 |
| cd       |                                                    364 |
| ra       |                                                    526 |
| sle      |                                                    382 |
| t1d      |                                                    336 |
| uc       |                                                    364 |

These numbers don't really tell us if we are losing *signals*, though. We might tolerate dropping a few SNPs from a tower provided it's still visible in the Manhattan. I highlighted the top 20 PID SNPs in the results to see if signals were retained in `fcfdr` results.
