## TODOs from last meeting

Only to run `fcfdr`, really.

## What I've done this week

Not much to report in the way of results. 

I wrote scripts to run LDAK and `fcfdr` on the IMD data sets. Running LDAK was straightforward, but I have run into some problems with `fcfdr`:

1. memory requirements
2. sign of Spearman's rank-order correlation of principal and auxiliary p-values changes between whole data set and independent SNP-only subset

The first issue is fixed by simply increasing `cpus-per-task` and using `skylake-himem`, but I can't help but think I'm doing something incorrect in the way I call the `fcfdr` code. Some jobs fail on `skylake-himem` with `cpus-per-task=3`, but surely they don't need 48 GB+ of memory on a typical GWAS data set when run correctly? I don't know how `fcfdr` works yet, so perhaps they do. I used `profvis` with `cfdr` to profile time and will use it with `fcfdr` to profile memory usage.  

The second issue is more serious. Of the 8 IMD data sets (T2D omitted due to lack of rsIDs and the fact we have CAD as one control), the problem of the sign of Spearman's rank changing between the whole data set and the independent subset selected using LDAK weights has come up in four of them. Recall we compute the correlation between the PID and IMD p-values. The `fcfdr::flexible_cfdr` function does not allow one to proceed if the sign of Spearman's differs between the two.  I don't know why `fcfdr` stipulates this, but I'm looking into it. 

This issue caused me to wonder whether Spearman's rank is a reliable indicator of the sort of enrichment we care about in this context. How does it differ between different subsets? 

I tabulated the value of Spearman's rank for several subsets of the IMD SNPs as well as the AUC observed when using `cfdr`:

1. Whole set: all SNPs from intersection of IMD with PID (used in Q-Q plots).
2. 1000G intersection: SNPS from intersection of whole set (as defined in 1.) with 1000G SNPs used to calculate LDAK weights. This is the subset that would be passed as input to `fcfdr`.
3. Independent SNPs: those in the independent subset identified by LDAK
4. AUC: excess area under the curve given by using `cfdr` over normal `FDR` (see final plot on this page). A summary of how many more discoveries we make at various FDR cut-offs by using cFDR.

|------------|-----------|--------------------|------------------|--------|
| aster_pid  |    0.0007 |             0.0008 |          -0.0010 | -164.0 |
| cd_pid     |    0.0066 |             0.0068 |           0.0001 | 1110.0 |
| t1d_pid    |    0.0081 |             0.0080 |           0.0028 | 5690.0 |
| asthma_pid |    0.0020 |             0.0019 |          -0.0010 | 1719.5 |
| ra_pid     |   -0.0009 |            -0.0007 |           0.0017 | 1581.0 |
| uc_pid     |    0.0026 |             0.0033 |           0.0011 |  870.0 |
| cad_pid    |    0.0018 |             0.0015 |          -0.0015 |  117.5 |
| sle_pid    |    0.0036 |             0.0037 |           0.0017 | 6038.5 |

The difference in sign between '1000G intersection' and 'Independent SNPs' is what is causing `fcfdr` to throw an exception in four cases. 

I annotated stratified Q-Q plots with Spearman's rank, too, but it's hard to identify any relationship between the magnitude of the deflection and the value of Spearman's rank (at least without resorting to the 'eye of faith'). Andreassen et al. used an estimate of FDR as a summary statistic for this deflection but I don't have those values to hand at the moment.

In addition to the deflection in the stratified Q-Q plots, as a measure of enrichment we can also look at the no. of additional discoveries at certain FDRs when using `cfdr` (I don't have `fcfdr` results yet). We previously used excess area under the curve (AUC) as an informal measure of how many more discoveries we make with cFDR at various FDR thresholds.

I computed Spearman's rank-order correlation between AUC, and the '1000G intersection' and 'Independent SNPs' correlation values. The correlation ('of correlations with AUC') was 0.524 and 0.667 for the 1000G and independent sets, respectively. This suggests to me that Spearman's is at least indicative of which traits are likely to be more useful as covariates on which to condition when forced to choose between a set of them. Nonetheless, the small magnitude of the correlations and the sign-changing troubles me.
