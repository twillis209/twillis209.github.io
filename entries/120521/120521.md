## What I've done this week

### PID-four IMD fcFDR

On the basis of the GPS test statistics, I selected aster, t1d, ra, and cd, before switching cd for ibd at Chris's suggestion.

The following depicts final v-values output by the procedure for each set of four IMDs:

I spent time thinking about how to automate the workup of our genome-wide significant SNPs. On each chromosome, I sorted by v-value, picked the most significant SNP as the 'lead SNP', then excluded SNPs in a window of 500kbp and iterated.
